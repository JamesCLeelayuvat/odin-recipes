    <h2>Blah blah blah blah</h2>
    <ul>
        Ingredients
        <li>1 pound 93% lean ground turkey</li>

        <li>1 cups fresh bread crumbs</li>

        <li> 1 large egg, lightly beaten</li>

        <li>2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley</li>

        <li>1 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce</li>

        <li>1 teaspoons garlic powder</li>

        <li>½ teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>

        <li>½ teaspoon onion powder</li>

        <li>1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        Steps
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil. Coat a wire rack
            with
            nonstick cooking spray, set on prepared baking sheet, and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Combine ground turkey, bread crumbs, egg, parsley, Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, Italian seasoning,
            onion
            powder, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Using a 2-teaspoon cookie scoop, shape the mixture into 1-inch
            balls
            and place on the baking rack.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 12 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat. Add onion and celery and cook until softened,
            about
            5 minutes. Add tomatoes, chicken broth, potatoes, carrots, peas, basil, and red pepper flakes; stir until
            well
            combined. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer, uncovered, until potatoes and carrots are
            cooked and the broth has somewhat reduced, 20 to 25 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir in meatballs and simmer until heated through, 5 to 7 minutes. Season stew with salt and pepper.
        </li>
    </ol>
